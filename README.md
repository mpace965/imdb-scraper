IDMB Top 250 Scraper
====================

I made this script a while ago and decided to put it on GitHub. Someone posted a link to the top 250 movies on IMDB on Facebook. I decided that I had to find out how long it would take to watch all of them.

Answer (as of 9/2/14): (532.3 hours)[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=532.3+hours].

Ideas for polishing:
* Create a text buffer for percentage, or maybe a progress bar
* Make it go faster?
